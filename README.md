The program is ideal for anyone looking to create unique, dynamic text displays in their console applications.

## Why I Made It
I created **Printer** to explore different ways to represent text in a console environment, while also demonstrating the flexibility of C# and .NET 5. The idea came from the need for a simple but fun program that could make console applications more interesting, creative, and visually striking without requiring complex GUI development.
